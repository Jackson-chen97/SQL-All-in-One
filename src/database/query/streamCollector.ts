 * its existing public API. The streaming path is the memory win: rows are
 * pulled lazily from the adapter, so the underlying driver never buffers the
 * entire result set in one shot.
 *
 * Behavior contract (verified by streaming.test.ts):
 *
 * - The first batch's `columns` populate the result's column metadata.
 * - Rows accumulate up to `maxRows`; the stream is abandoned (no further
 *   pulls) once the cap is reached.
 * - If a batch reports `truncated === true` the collector stops pulling
 *   further batches.
 * - If the stream throws, the error is converted to a `status: 'error'`
 *   {@link QueryResult} (code `STREAM_ERROR`) so callers see the same
 *   error-shape they would from {@link IDatabaseAdapter.execute}.
